#### Dashbird makes sure your application works at all times by collecting logs through your AWS Cloudwatch API.

Having all logs in one place helps you have a quick bird's eye perspective on your lambda functions, resources, and services. By fetching existing logs from your AWS CloudWatch API, Dashbird does not require any code instrumentation or changes. Your Lambdas execution time will have zero impact as well.
