Nowadays, we need to pay for almost every service we use. Starting with our operating systems, antivirus software, for which we need to pay for a license to use. 

Also, if we wish to use various online services, we need to register an account on their website. Furthermore, we need to pay to be able to use the service entirely. The bottom line is that when we make an estimate of how many services and licenses we need to pay for, we conclude that it’s not a small amount on a monthly or yearly basis. 

Therefore, we must find strategies to optimize the cost of all the things we use and the services we need. A similar case is our AWS Lambda usage. In today’s article, we’ll try to uncover three AWS Lambda cost optimization strategies.

## What Is Cost Optimization?

One of the main reasons for choosing to move into the cloud is the ability to reduce costs. Therefore it's essential to optimize how much you spend, so you only pay for what you need and only when you need it. Optimizing costs will help your organization get the most out of your investment, helping to meet demand and capacity while using the most economically useful options that AWS offers. 

This cost optimization allows you to decide how much, when, and in which cases, you’ll pay for the service provided to you. AWS will enable you to easily pick the right size for your service and leverage memory size based on how much you need.

You’re also able to use any of our incredible [cost management tools](/features/) that will allow you to monitor your costs and that way you’ll always be on top of the how much you’re spending on this service.

## Working Strategies On Reducing Cost

You’re enabled to control your AWS cost by following a few straightforward steps. First off, we’ll mention **choosing the right size** which means that with AWS you can set the memory (and CPU power) of your AWS Lambda functions to meet precisely the necessary capacities that you need. 

There’s no need over-provision or make compromises. Being able to adapt your services to address the actual business needs at any given time, without any penalties or hidden fees whatsoever. AWS allows you to choose between services which meet your criteria, and while your demands change it is quite easy to switch to the service option which will cover for your new requirements. AWS also gives you the opportunity to run multiple service options at the same time, helping you to reduce costs while maintaining the optimal performance at all times.

Another way would be utilizing Step-Functions to find the optimal memory capacity for your functions. Here's an [open source module](https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning) built by [Sr. Tech. Evangelist Alex Casalboni of AWS](https://blog.alexcasalboni.com/).

## Cost Reduction Through Observability

With a proper observability system in place your company will for sure minimize the risks that inherently come with serverless architectures. You will also have a way to manage the budget in a predictable manner, in a way that complies with policies that require commitments on a long-term basis.  

This would include **monitoring, tracking, analyzing, and alerting** your service usage and with a trusted advisor, so you are able to provision your resources by keeping up with the best possible practices in order to improve system performance and reliability. 

It will also increase the security, and give you opportunities to save some money. CloudWatch is an options which (in case you decide to turn off non-production functions) will allow you to match increases or reductions that are in demand. It will collect and track the metrics, monitor log files, and automatically respond to any changes made within your AWS resources. 

But it doesn't give you full insight into your system, or instant alerts when things break. For that you need a tool that will make sure to alert you instantly when your system is misbehaving.

## More Opportunities

There are other ways to reduce cost and optimize it to your own needs. Cost Explorer can help you with analyzing your usage and cost. It is a magnificent tool that allows you to use a set of default reports so that you can start with the identification of cost drivers and usage trends. Dashbird's own cost tracking system, which you can see on a account-wide scale or per-function basis also gives you a real-time presentation of how much your services are costing you.

There are various choices to make and strategies to use to reduce the cost and optimise it to your own needs. The essential things you need to realise is to discover which of the given approaches best suit your personal needs. After finding out what you need, it’ll be much easier to choose a more personalised way to reduce the cost.
