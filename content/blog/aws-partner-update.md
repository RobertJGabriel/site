It's the celebration time of the year! Dashbird is now an official Amazon Web Services (AWS) [Advanced Technology Partner (APN)](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Dashbird&id=0010L00001rCurgQAC). Our team has demonstrated that we can build a strong, secure and reliable AWS-based business that can benefit Amazon Web Services users.

The new partner status is recognition of Dashbird ability to help companies to better monitor and troubleshoot their Lambdas by providing state of the art solution for serverless observability.

> "We have worked together with AWS since the beginning of Dashbird and we believe in building a strong relationship with them," said Taavi Rehemägi, Co-Founder and CEO of Dashbird. "We are pleased to continue extend our partnership with AWS to help our mutual customers to build their serverless services with more confidence."

### What will this mean for you?
You’ll not be directly impacted by this partnership but indirectly, you can rest assured that by using Dashbird you are going to take full advantage of a product supported and endorsed by AWS. This will encourage us to uphold the premium quality standard that the AWS users have come to expect from using Amazon products and services.
